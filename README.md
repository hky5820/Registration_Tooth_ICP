# Tooth Data Registration with PCA+ICP

## Language

C++ but like C 
( When i make this code, i am not good at c++ and class of it.  
  So, if i have time to remake this code, i will treat all of this code in class.  
  And, recently i make another 3D-3D PCA code that is wrapped with class.  
  so i will post it in soon, and i think 3D-3D PCA code is more read, see friendly )  

## USAGE

I did not adjust Eigen library path
Before runing, you should adjust lib path

## Data
